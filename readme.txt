== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I loose any data? =

Plugin data should not be lost when deactivating your plugins.

= My site has broken =

Your theme might be dependent on a plugin that was active. A quick fix is to rename the folder name of the current theme which will let you access the plugin page. Then reactivate the offending plugin. After this you can then return the name of your plugin folder and the site will be usable again.
