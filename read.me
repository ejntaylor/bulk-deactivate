Head to Plugins > Bulk Deactivate

Pressing the deactivate button will deactivate all plugins except itself.

The list of deactivated plugins is then saved on the right hand side. You can activate all of these or choose to activate only a selection.

In the advanced settings area you can change how the the saved list is overwritten.
